I developed a full interactive Power BI dashboard using the FreeCodeCamp Survey dataset to explore 
how aspiring developers learn, what career paths they want, and what challenges they face. 
The project included detailed data cleaning in Power Query, unpivoting multiple resource columns, 
organizing fields into logical categories, and building calculated columns and advanced DAX measures. 
I designed several dashboard pages with clear navigation, consistent layouts, custom labels, 
and a drill-through profile page for deeper analysis. 
The visuals highlight job interests, expected earnings, learning resources, programming experience, 
demographics, motivations, and financial responsibilities. Completing this project strengthened my skills 
in data modeling, DAX logic, Power BI UI/UX design, and turning complex data into meaningful insights 
similar to real-world business intelligence work.
