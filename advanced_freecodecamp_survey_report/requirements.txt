Project Requirements — Advanced FreeCodeCamp Survey Dashboard

This project is an interactive analytics dashboard built to explore results from an advanced FreeCodeCamp survey. 
It focuses on meaningful visualizations, clean data modeling, and insightful interpretation. 
Below are the full requirements, tools, and setup instructions for running or modifying the project.



1. Project Overview

* Analyze a large FreeCodeCamp survey dataset
* Build meaningful KPIs, charts, and advanced DAX calculations
* Use page navigation and a clean UI/UX
* Provide clear explanations of insights and trends
* Focus on the **purpose** behind each visualization, not only visuals



2. Technologies Used

Power BI Desktop (latest version recommended)
Power Query for data cleaning
DAX for calculated columns & measures
Data modeling (relationships, fact/dimension tables)
Optional: Excel or CSV editor for preprocessing
