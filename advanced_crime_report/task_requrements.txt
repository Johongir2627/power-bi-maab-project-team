✔ Created What-if Parameter for **Month filtering**
✔ Handled null demographics using default values
✔ Extracted location columns & categorized them for Map visuals


4. DAX Measures

| Measure Name          | Purpose                                                |

| Total Crimes          | COUNT(Crime_ID)                                        |
| Arrest Made Count     | CALCULATE(COUNT(Crime_ID), Crime[Arrest_Made]="Yes")   |
| Domestic Cases        | CALCULATE(COUNT(Crime_ID), Crime[Domestic_Case]="Yes") |
| Gang Related Cases    | CALCULATE(COUNT(Crime_ID), Crime[Gang_Related]="Yes")  |
| Selected Month Crimes | Filter using Month parameter                           |
| Dynamic Titles        | SELECTEDVALUE() used for drill-through                 |



5. Visual Requirements

| Page           | Visuals Used                                                      |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Overview       | KPI Cards, Donut Chart, Bar Chart, Slicer                         |

| Location-Based | Map, Heatmap, Table by City/Neighborhood                          |
| Demographics   | Age Distribution, Gender Charts, Weapon Usage, Relationship Types |
| Case Details   | Drill-through table, cards, slicers for case-level data           |



6. Interactivity Requirements

✔ **Drill-through pages** (based on Crime_Type, Neighborhood, Severity)
✔ **Bookmarks & Page Navigation**
✔ **Sync Slicers across pages**
✔ **Drill-down hierarchy on Date**
✔ **Dynamic titles using DAX**
✔ **Parameters for month filtering**



7. Functional Goals
