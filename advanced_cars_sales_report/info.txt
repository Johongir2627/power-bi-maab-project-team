Project Overview – Car Sales Analytics Dashboard

This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of car sales performance using real transactional data. 
It covers sales trends, pricing comparison against MMR, vehicle conditions, seller performance, 
customer preferences, and geographic insights. The dashboard is fully interactive, using slicers, drill-throughs, 
bookmarks, DAX calculations, and data modeling techniques to enable dynamic business analysis.

The solution helps stakeholders evaluate market behavior, identify profitable models, detect underpriced vehicles, 
track seller contributions, and forecast sales using time intelligence. With professional design and advanced features, 
this dashboard serves as a decision-support tool for dealerships, finance departments, and automotive analysts.
